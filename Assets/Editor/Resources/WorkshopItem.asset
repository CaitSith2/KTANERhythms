  Title: Rythms
  Description: "[i]Have you ever taken a music theory class where you had to count
    and clap rhythms? This is just like that, only here your suffering ends when you
    get it wrong.[/i]\r\n\r\nCount the rhythm of the flashing light, and hit the correct
    button.\r\n\r\n[h1]About[/h1]\r\n\r\nWhen I saw that, not only was there modded
    modules, but someone had made a piano keyboard module, I just had to start working
    on an entire set of music-themed modules. This is the first entry in that set.\r\n\r\n[h1]Manual
    Pages[/h1]\r\n\r\nA pdf file of the manual is included with the download. If you
    would like the html version for some reason, let me know and I'll work something
    out.\r\n\r\n[u]Note:[/u] If you are not familiar with standard musical note durations,
    you will need to find a musical reference to solve this module.\r\n\r\nThe ID
    of this module is MusicRhythms.\r\n\r\n[h1]Known Issues:[/h1]\r\n\r\nThe logging
    output may still be lacking\n\r\nThere are spelling mistakes in the title of this
    module in the manual."
